## Overview

This repository contains a series of Git tasks that help new developers learn Git through practical exercises. Each task in the repository is designed to illustrate different aspects of Git version control, including:

- Creating a repository
- Adding and committing files
- Creating and switching branches
- Merging branches and resolving conflicts
- Reverting commits and using Git logs

The goal is to familiarize users with Git's version control features and collaborative workflow.

## Prerequisites

To get started, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Git**: [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- **Text editor or IDE**: VSCode, Sublime Text, or any code editor of your choice

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mayurdubal/Git-task.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Git-task
   ```

3. You are now ready to explore the Git commands and tasks outlined below.

## Git Commands Used

Some of the Git commands you'll encounter while working on this project include:

- `git init` – Initialize a new Git repository
- `git add` – Stage changes for the next commit
- `git commit` – Commit staged changes to the repository
- `git status` – Show the status of your working directory
- `git branch` – List, create, or delete branches
- `git checkout` – Switch between branches
- `git merge` – Merge changes from one branch into another
- `git log` – View commit history
- `git reset` – Undo commits and changes
- `git stash` – Temporarily store changes
- `git remote` – Manage set of tracked repositories

## Tasks

Here are some tasks you can perform in this repository to practice Git concepts:

1. **Create a new branch**:
   ```bash
   git branch <branch-name>
   git checkout <branch-name>
   ```

2. **Add and commit changes**:
   - Make changes to any file in the project.
   - Stage the changes and commit:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Added changes to file"
     ```

3. **Merge branches**:
   - Switch back to the `main` branch:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     ```
   - Merge changes from your branch into the `main` branch:
     ```bash
     git merge <branch-name>
     ```

4. **Resolve merge conflicts**:
   - Create a conflict scenario by making changes to the same file in two different branches.
   - Use Git's conflict resolution tools to fix the conflict and commit the result.

5. **Revert commits**:
   - Learn how to revert changes using `git revert` or `git reset`.

6. **Push to remote repository**:
   - Push your local changes to a remote repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin <branch-name>
     ```
